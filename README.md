# Introduction/Background
Companies' HR recruiting departments often face the challenge to set priorities in their job offer. 
Should I increase the compensation? 
Should I offer more flexibility in terms of remote/onsite work?
What about ….

In order to give the companies some orientation, I analysed the results of a developer survey on StackOverflow from 2017. Precisely, I focused on the main fields of interest for an employee when applying for a job.
The following questions were adressed:
What are the 5 most relevant fields for an employee when applying for a job?
Do female job candidates focus on different fields than male ones when applying for a job?
Does the origin of job candidates have an influence on the most relevant fields, when applying for a job?

# Points of further action
Methods in the Jupyter Notebook could be used to analyze other variables than Country, Gender
Deeper analysis on the derived fields of interest:
- What is the best way for professional development
- Which technology should be used?
- What is a convincing salary offer?
