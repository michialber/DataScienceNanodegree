# Introduction/Background
Companies' HR recruiting departments often face the challenge to set priorities in their job offer. 
Should I increase the compensation? 
Should I offer more flexibility in terms of remote/onsite work?
What about ….

In order to give the companies some orientation, I analysed the results of a developer survey on StackOverflow from 2017. Precisely, I focused on the main fields of interest for an employee when applying for a job.
The following questions were adressed:
What are the 5 most relevant fields for an employee when applying for a job?
Do female job candidates focus on different fields than male ones when applying for a job?
Does the origin of job candidates have an influence on the most relevant fields, when applying for a job?

# Answers raised in the Jupyter Notebook and corresponding answers
Question 1: What are the 5 most relevant fields for an employee when applying for a job?
Answer to question 1:
Opportunities for professional development
Compensation and benefits offered
Languages, frameworks and other technologies to work with
Office environment
Amount of time necessary to spend for commuting

Question 2: Do female job candidates focus on different fields than male ones when applying for a job?
Answer to question 2:
Obviously, the gender doesn’t have a deciding impact on the interests. If — inspite of this fact — HR recruting tends to personalize job interviews, it should take into account the following illustration.Besides focussing on opportunities for professional development which holds true for men and women: In case of female candidates, you could highlight the office environment. In case of male candidates, you could highlight the compensation and benefits ordered.

Question 3: Does the origin of job candidates have an influence on the most relevant fields, when applying for a job?
Answer to question 3:
When comparing Germany to the overall picture, it is obvious that professional development is the most important field of interest. In terms of more personalized job offers you could highlight successful projects of your company instead of commuting circumstances.Having a look at India, it shows a quite similar behaviour as Germany. A possible customizing could be the highlighting of the future role for the job candidate.When it comes to the analysis of potential employees in the US, the most obvious deviation from the overall picture is the most relevant field. In every case, HR recruiting should highlight a convincing package of compensation and benefits .


# Points of further action
Methods in the Jupyter Notebook could be used to analyze other variables than Country, Gender
Deeper analysis on the derived fields of interest:
- What is the best way for professional development
- Which technology should be used?
- What is a convincing salary offer?
- .....
